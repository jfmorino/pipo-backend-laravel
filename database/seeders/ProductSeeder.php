                It's much more than the yellow dial which makes this new offering from the English manufacturers a style leader, although the yellow is hard to ignore! Rather than dominate the look of the watch, it sits beautifully alongside the white hands (which are outlined in black), providing a stark contrast yet achieving a modern look and feel.

                The black stainless steel strap (which we will resize for free) adds the layer of elegance and sophistication which brings together these clashes of style into one cohesive and timeless watch. You wouldn’t normally expect to see such a vibrant and playful watch as a chronograph, but you can here you can enjoy all the benefits that a stopwatch and an independent sweep second hand add to this unique piece.",
